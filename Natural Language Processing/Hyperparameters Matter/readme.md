## Abstract

- Optimal hyperparameters values are often known to be data and task dependent

- We thus investigate the marginal importance of each hyperparameter in a recommendation setting through large hyperparameter grid searches on various datasets

## Word2vec

- Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)
