## Binomial Distribution

The distribution of the number correct.

## Hypothesis test

- We calculate an appropriate test statistic (based on sample data), and determine how much evidence there is against the null hypothesis.

- If the evience is string enough (if it meets a certain _significance level_), we can rejuct the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

## z-test

- $\sigma$ is known

- test statistics:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}/ \sqrt{n}},
$$

$\mu:$ true mean. $n:$ sample size.

## $p$-value

- The probability of getting the observed value of the test statistic, or a value with even greater evidence against $H_0$, if $H_0$ is true.

- If we have a given significance level $\alpha$, then

> Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $\le \alpha$

- If $p$-value $\le \alpha$, the evidence against $H_0$ is significant at the $\alpha$ level of significance.

## t-test

- $\sigma$ is not known

## Normality test (Normal QQ plot)
