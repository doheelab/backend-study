## Stiffness Matrix

Stiffness matrix describe the relation between applied **forces** and refulsting **displacement**.

$$
stiffness \times displacement = force
$$

$$
KD = Force
$$
In a matrix form,
$$
k_{ij} = \text{force at "i" generated by a unit deflection at "j"}
$$

## Finite Element Method

FEM is a particular numerical method for solving partial differential equations in two or three space variables (i.e., some boundary value problems).

To solve a problem, the FEM subdivides a large system into smaller, simpler parts that are called **finite elements**.

The finite element method formulation of a boundary value problem finally results in a system of algebraic equations.

The FEM then uses variational methods from the calculus of variations to approximate a solution by minimizing an associated error function.

## Basic concepts

FEA is a good choice for analyzing problems over complicated domains (like cars and oil pipelines), when the domain changes (as during a solid-state reaction with a moving boundary), when the desired precision varies over the entire domain, or when the solution lacks smoothness.
