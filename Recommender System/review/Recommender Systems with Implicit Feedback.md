## Recommender Systems with Implicit Feedback Challenges, Techniques, and Applications

## One-class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF) problem

- Problem
  - setting (clicked or unknown) versus multi-class setting
- Challenges
  - Less Information to capture a user's taste than multi-class setting
  - More sparse datasets than in multi-class setting

- Existing OCCF approaches
  - Common concept
    - View all unrated items as negative preferences
    - e.g., WRMF, BPRMF
  - Challenge
    - Less effective in dealing with **sparse dataset** with many unrated items
